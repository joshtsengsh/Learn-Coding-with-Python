#This file illustrates how if-else statements are used in Python, where the "if" is followed by the "else"

#This input assumes the user will always type in a whole number, aka integer
user_input = int(input("Please enter a whole number: "))

if user_input%2!=0:
    print("This is an odd number")
else:
    print("This is an even number")

#Your task: decipher how this code works
