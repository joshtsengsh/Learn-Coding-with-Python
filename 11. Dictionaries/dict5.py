#Imagine this dictionary contains user details for a bank
#The format for data is as follows:
#User ID: [Name, Phone number, Amount of money in bank in dollars]

user_database = {
"001": ["John Tan", "92234456", 0.0],
"002": ["Raj Sara", "82284545", 100.5],
"003": ["Katrina Brown", "99493345", 102.23]
}

#Print entire dictionary
print(user_database)
