#This file illustrates what lists are and how they can be used

#Creating a list
#Lists are used to store multiple values in one variable
#All lists are created with square brackets, and their values are separated by commas
#Lists can contain 0 or more values

#Example 1: An empty list
list_one = []
print(list_one)

#Show the type
print(type(list_one))

#Example 2: List with 1 string value
list_two = ["apple"]
print(list_two)

#Eample 3: List with multiple integer values
list_three = [3, 5, 2, 1, 0]
print(list_three)

#Example 4: List containing multiple values of different data types
list_four = [0.55, 5, "Friday", False, True, "Hello"]
print(list_four)
