#This file will illustrate how you can accept inputs and manipulate strings

user_input = input("Please type a number here: ")
#The code above will ask the user for a number. Try typing a number into the terminal and hit enter

print("The number you typed in is"+user_input)
#The code above will display the message and your number
#Adding strings together with the plus sign is called concatination

#There is a problem with the code above; try to run it in the terminal and see the output
#Hint: One of the messages should have a space that is not there
#How do you fix this?
