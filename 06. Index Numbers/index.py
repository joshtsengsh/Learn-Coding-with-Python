#This file introduces the concept of index numbers, which are important when handling certain types of data in Python
#In this example, we would be looking at the indexes in strings

sample_string = "This is my string."

#Show the value in the string at index position 0
print(sample_string[0])

#Exercise:
#Change the number in the bracket to: -1, 2, 9, and 34.
#What changes?
