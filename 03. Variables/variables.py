#This file will illustrate how to create variables in Python

#Variables are used to store values, like containers
#Give your variable a name, then use an equal sign to give it a value


my_string = "Welcome to the Willy Wonka factory!"
my_integer = 400

print("Showing what is inside your variables:")

print("my_string variable:")
print(my_string)

print("my_integer variable:")
print(my_integer)

#Additional notes:
#There are naming conventions to naming variables, you can find more about this by looking at the included document in this folder
