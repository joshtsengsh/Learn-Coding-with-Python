#This file shows you how to compare different values in Python

num1 = 5
num2 = 10

#Using == sign to find out if two values are equal
print("Is num1 == num2?")
print(num1==num2)

#Using != sign to find out if two values are not equal
print("Is num1 != num2 // Are they not equal?")
print(num1 != num2)

#Using <=, >=, <, and >
#<= is less than or equal to, >= is greater than or equal to
#< and > are just comparing less than or greater than
print("Is num1 <= num1?")
print(num1 <= num1)
print("Is num1 < num1?")
